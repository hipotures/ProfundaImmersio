# Profunda Immersio (English Summary)

**Profunda Immersio** is planned as a VR puzzle game for WebXR. The player manipulates falling blocks in a threeâ€‘dimensional well to clear horizontal layers and achieve the highest possible score. The interface should remain minimalist and futuristic while offering many configuration options.

Main features described in the Polish PRD include:

- Support for various board sizes with color coded depth layers
- Block movement with the right controller and rotation with the left controller
- Multiple rotation systems (SRS, ARS) configurable via YAML
- Optional ghost piece preview and upcoming piece queue
- Scoring system that rewards clearing several layers at once
- Difficulty levels adjusting the allowed placement time
- VR HUD and settings menu for toggling options like sound and haptics
- Progressive Web App build using Vite and TypeScript

For the complete requirements see [`prd.txt`](prd.txt) (Polish). The implementation tasks are listed in [`task-complexity-report.json`](task-complexity-report.json).
